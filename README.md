Here is a classifier with 0.9377 training and 0.8827 testing accuracy WITHOUT using a pre-trained model. The model uses a set of simple Convolutional neural networks with batch normalization and dropout methods to reduce overfitting. Image augmentation was implemented due to the low amount of different training data.
